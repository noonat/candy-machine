Oh, hello there! You've played [Candy Box], right? No? Well get to it, then!
I'll be here waiting when you're ready.

Back? Tired of clicking the quest button? Well, look no further! I have
here, in my bag of tricks, the very thing to cure what ails you. It's a
user script (for Chrome or Greasemonkey) that \*ahem\* *automates* some
of the more common tasks.

What's that you say? Clicking those buttons to earn candy is the whole
point of the thing? Fiddlesticks, I say! Now let's see how far my
character has gotten while I was sleeping...
